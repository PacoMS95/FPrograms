  ANALYSIS
  
  Name: Exercise2point17.java
  
  Goal: Write an application that reads five integers and determines and prints thouse integers
  that are the biggest and the smallest.
  
  Input: five integers via keyboard.
  
  Output: those five integers from the input but in descendant order.
  
  Suppositions: the input numbers are really integers and no other type.
  
  GENERAL PSEUDOCODE
  Variables
  	integers: number1,number2,number3,number4,number5.
  Start
  	show instructions
  	ask for numbers
  	find&show biggest
  	find&show smallest	
  End
